A monorepo of my explorations and notes of different ML patterns

* `multi_out`: Show how multiple predictions can be made at once
* `regression_prediction`: A simple deep neural network regression example for predicting a continuous value (and fast model persistence)
* `anomaly`: exampls of sequence (string) anomaly detection (with model persistence), and timeseries anomaly detection using long-shortterm memory
